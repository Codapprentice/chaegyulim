My research interest lies in the area of Haptics, both practical applications and theoretical perspectives. I focus on finding solutions to provide immersive tactile experience to users leveraging my expertise in soft robotics! Here are research topics I have focused on in relation to the aforementioned content are as follows.

1️⃣ Design of tactile devices using variable-stiffness materials

2️⃣ Mathematical modeling of an actuator that emits strong ultrasound at a single focus 

I was a research scientist at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) under the supervision of a senior researcher, Seungwon Kim. Before that, I received my M.S. from Korea University under the supervision of Professor Youngsu Cha, where I studied soft robotics and mechatronics for haptic device. I received my B.S. from Korea University.
